    <H1>Background</H1>
    <H2>Family</H2>
    <p>My parents were 27 years old when I was born. They were working at esteemed accounting companies that had strict working schedules, so I was frequently in the care of my mom's brother, Josh, and his wife, Heather. At the time, Josh an Heather had a son of their own, Jasper, that was three years older than me. Two years later, my brother, Rowan, was born and my family moved to San Rafael- with my aunt and uncle close behind. My parents both grew up in Southern California; they met at Sonoma State University and cn=oninues their life in Northern California. For the majority of my life, I only saw my family three times a year because of he commute. Now, my grandparens on my mom's side and most of her siblings have moved to Marin and I get to se them significantly more. They are all goofy and kindhearted, it's amazing when I am able to make hem laugh.
        <H2>Early Life</H2>
        <p>When I was younger, I went on many advntures with my family. My parents have taken my brother and I to many countries across the globe, including: Italy, Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, France, and England. As a kid I would look forwar to the summers that I could go out on my grandma's boat and go fishing. We normally spent three days out on the water, and when we came back to shore, Papa Tom would deep fry the rock fish we caught. At the age of three I started ballet classes at a local dance studio and continues to dance ballet for nine years. In elementary school, I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich everyday then in middle school the jelly was replace by nutella. Every Thanksgiving and Christmas is hosted at my house, requiring my parents to rent an extra table for he day. Growing up, I would feed the ducks, fly to Wyoming, have an annual Disneyland visits, and pick oranges with my grandparents. What a life.</p>
