    <H1>Phoebe Alexandra Johnson</H1>
    <H2>Personality</H2>
    <p>I have been defined with many adjectives and apparently my personality ecompasses the words: bubbly, intelligent, poetic, supportive, energetic, comical, independent, and eccentic. Actually, recently one of my friends, to my surprise, associated me with the word 'sweet', which is not a side of myself that is normally expressed openly. As you may know at this point, I am a very quirky person that doesn't tend to act within the conventional behavior of my peers.</p>
    <H2>Goals</H2>
    <p>Throughout my life I have been motivated to perform to the best of my abilities in school and any extracurriculars I participated in. This year I do not only strive for a GPA above a 4.0, but also to be accepted into the universites I have been working so hard for these past four years. It is important to me that I foster a deep understanding of both the mathematic and coding worlds since they are the fields I wish to pursue for my future career. Likewise, I aim to greatly improve my golf game in hopes of recieving the MVP award for a second year. It is a game that I still consider myself new to; however, golf has become a very significant part of my life that I hope to continue (anything is significant if you spend 15 hours a week trying to perfect it).</p>
