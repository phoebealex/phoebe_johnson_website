    <H3>A Little More Context</H3>
    <p>I have enjoyed reading since the beginning of middle school when my mom brought home a series of fantasy novels. From then on I would spend nearly every weekend walking to Copperfield's to find another journey I could immerse myself in. I now have a bookshelf filled with neverending pages. Photography has been a part of my life for what seems like forever since my aunt used to do it professionally and my parents had a desire to document everything. It became more prominent in my life when I received a Nikon camera for Christmas when I was 14. Now I frequently wake up at 5 in the mornign on random days of the week and accompany my many surfer friends to the beach. I have been filming and takeing pictures of these five guys surfing for almost three years now. It makes me happy when they paddle in and see that I shot one of their best waves. I have been dancing since the age of three; I started at Marin Ballet and danced there for 9 years. Then I decided that I wanted a less structured style of dance and got invested in contemporary for about five years. Over the last two years I have found most of my enjoyment in hip-hop; in this style you don't only feel like a boss, but you can use different skills to create illusions within your performances. Drawing also started at a yound age, like many children, I began to draw the moment I could hold a crayon between my chubby fingers. This skill significantly developed in my late middle school years and continued to improve until I decided to take AP Art last year. After passing the AP test with a 4 I decided to switch up electives, but I occasionally do some pen work (my specialty) on my own time. I have been playing golf for almost four years now. I started on the San Rafael High's boy's golf team for my first two years then helped found the girl's golf team last year. I received the MVP award last year ad hope to continue that achievement this year. I suppose my love for poetry is a result from my vigorous reading addiction; there is just something about the perfect portrayal of emotions through metaphors that alures me. Whenever I am feeling overwhelmed, I tend to jot down some poetic lines until I feel a release on tention in my head. Another form of release for me is music. I listen to all types: jazz, rap, hip-hop, indie, and alternative. I am thoroughly amused by the days I spend stuck to my computer, digging for a new song or talented artist.</p>
